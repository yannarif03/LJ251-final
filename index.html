  <h1 align="center">No Longer Human Image Gallery</h1>
  <h2 align="center">by Yann Arif</h2>

  <p align="center" style="height:auto;">This is my final project for LJ251. It focuses on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Longer_Human">No Longer Human,
    A book by Osamu Dazai.</a> I've chosen to do an image gallery of AI generated images (get it, No Longer Human?) using a couple of
    important lines and quotes from the book, to see what a machine could make of it. after each one, I will add a little comment of my own
    to briefly analyze it. Enjoy!

    This will be where I talk about the first image mentioned in the prologue. The prompt was "a boy with a horrifying toothy grin surrounded by a great many women, most likely his sisters and cousins."
